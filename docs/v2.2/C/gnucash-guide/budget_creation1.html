Creating a Budget</h2></div></div><p>Even before you begin to make a budget, it's important to
   have given some thought to your account hierarchy.  For example, if
   you want to budget a certain amount for your electric bill and a
   certain amount for your water bill, you can't have only an
   Expenses:Utilities account.  Your accounts must be at least as
   specific as your budget.  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="budget_creation2"></a>15.2.1. Choose Which Accounts To Budget For</h3></div></div><p>The first step in creating a budget is to decide what it is
     you want to plan for.  This decision will affect which accounts
     you include in your budget.  For example, if you are only
     interested in tracking your expenses, you may create an expense
     budget by only entering amounts for expense accounts.  On the
     other hand, if you want to track all of your cash flow, you may
     create a cash flow budget by entering amounts for asset,
     liability, income and expense accounts.</p><p>Before you begin to create your budget, you need to make
     two decisions: What accounts do I want to budget for?  and When
     do I want my budget to be for?  You can always change your mind
     later, after you've created a budget, but you need to start with
     something.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">As a rule of thumb, if you mostly care about
     <b>what</b> you spend your money on, you may want
     to make an expense report.  If you're also concerned about having
     enough money in the right places at the right times, you may want
     to use a cash-flow budget.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id3050204"></a>15.2.2. Choosing a Budget Period</h3></div></div><p>Before creating a budget you must also decide what period of
    time you want to plan for.  The most common budget periods are
    monthly and annual.  If you want your budget to plan for changes
    in financial patterns over time, then you should include multiple
    budget periods in your budget.  For example, if you want to plan
    on having higher utility expenses in the winter than in the
    summer, then you might break your annual budget into 4 quarters or
    even 12 months, and budget a higher value for the winter periods
    than for the summer periods.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id3050225"></a>15.2.3. Getting Started</h3></div></div><p>To create your first budget click on <b>File</b> -&gt;
    <b>New</b> -&gt; <b>New Budget</b>.  You will
    immediately see a new budget with the default settings and no entries.
    Then click on the "Options" button.  The most important options are
    the budget period and the number of periods.  For the budget period,
    choose the beginning date and the smallest period of time that you
    want to plan for.  Then, for the number of periods, choose how many
    periods you want to plan for.</p><p>The budget page now shows a list of accounts with a column
    for each budget period.  The date shown in the title of each
    column is the beginning of that budget period.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id3050270"></a>15.2.4. Entering Budget Values</h3></div></div><p>Now, you must enter the budget values - the amounts that you
    expect the account balances to change during the budget period.
    There are two ways to enter budget values.  The first way is to
    simply click on the cell and enter an amount.</p><p>If you have past transactions recorded in GnuCash, the
    second way is to let GnuCash estimate the budget values by looking
    at those transactions.  First, select the accounts you want
    GnuCash to estimate.  Then click on the 'Estimate' toolbar button.
    In the Estimate Budget Values dialog, select the date past which
    GnuCash should look for past transactions.  GnuCash will start at
    that date and look forward for the duration of your budget.  For
    example, if you are making an annual budget, and you select
    Jan. 1, 2005, GnuCash will look at all the transactions in that
    account from Jan. 1, 2005 through Dec. 31, 2005.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="budget_concepts1.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="budget_reporting1.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">15.1.
