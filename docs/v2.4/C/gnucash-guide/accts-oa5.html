          is useful to reflect an agreement made with someone you trust.
          Suppose you lent someone $500 and he agreed to repay you $50 a month.
          If he paid on time, the loan you made would be paid off within a year,
          which is why it is classified as a short-term receivable. So you
          could record that loan initially in this account tree: <span class="emphasis"><strong>OtherAssets:Current Assets:LoanToJoe.</strong></span>
          At the time you give him the money: your
          entry is debit (increase) LoanToJoe $500 and credit (decrease) Bank
          $500. Each time you receive Joe’s payment you record $50 debit
          (increase) to Bank and credit (decrease) LoanToJoe.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Don’t become confused by the use of the word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Loan</span>”</span>.

          is one in which you spend your own money on behalf of someone else
          (your employer, perhaps) and later you receive repayment of what you
          spent. The case might be a business trip. The employer has a policy
          of covering (paying for) all authorized expenses. After the
          trip is over, the employee submits a report listing dates and amounts
          spent with receipts for all the expenditures. The employer reviews
          the report and pays for all items that it considers as having a valid business reason.
          (Normally, employees know in advance what the employer will
          reimburse, so only those items are recorded as a reimbursable expense
          on the employee’s books.)</p><p>Because a business trip can involve different kinds of expenditures
          (air travel, lodging, transportation at the destination, etc.),
          different kinds of expenditures would be recorded in the one account
          as long as the expenditures all related to the same trip. In other
          words, if a second trip is made before the first is fully settled, a
          second account for a different event could be set up. It would make
          sense to do this, if it would help to keep separate all the details of
          one trip from those of another. It is up to the person making the
          trip to decide how much trouble it would be to put separate trips in
          separate accounts or to put them all in the same account. The trip
          taker should remember that the account must be reconciled in order to
          know with certainty that all expenses have been reimbursed.</p><p>Recording the expenditures on the trip would be much the same.
          That is, if you paid trip expenses by cash you would debit (increase) the
          reimburseable expense account for the money paid in cash, because it
          is a receivable to you until it has been reimbursed to you. The credit
          offsetting your expenditure would decrease the account that shows the
          cash in your pocket or the account from which you drew the cash for
          the payment made. If you paid by credit card, the debit side would be
          the same as just described, but the credit would be an increase to the
          credit card company account on your books.</p><p>When you received your reimbursement, then the journal entry (or
          transaction) to record receipt of the funds from the employer would be:
          debit (increase) Bank for the check amount and credit (decrease) the
          reimbursable expense account for the check amount.</p><p>If it turns out that the reimbursable expense account is not
          zero balance after processing the employer’s payment, then it means that
          there is a difference between you and the employer in handling the expense,
          which needs to be investigated. If the balance is a debit
          (a positive balance), your account has some money that was not reimbursed.
          If the balance is a credit (a negative balance), you were paid for more
          than what you recorded as due you. In both of those situations you should
          reconcile the difference between what you recorded and what was paid.
          That effort should disclose exactly what is causing the discrepancy.
          You will need to contact the employer’s bookkeeper to know what was paid,
          if the reimbursement check was not accompanied by a detailed list of the
          items being paid you.</p><p>In the event the employer refused to reimburse you for an
          expenditure, that effectively makes it your expense. In that case, you
          would make this entry: debit (increase) your own Expense
          (appropriately named) and credit (decrease) the Reimbursable Expense
          account. That entry should result in a zero balance in the
          Reimbursable Expense account. If not, reconcile until you identify
          the difference.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" xmlns:doc="http://nwalsh.com/xsl/documentation/1.0" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">Sometimes there are small differences that don’t match an
          individual entry. In those cases divide the amount by 2 or by 9. If
          the unresolved amount is divisible by two, it suggests that both you
          and the employer entered the item in the same manner: both as debits
          or both as credits. If it is divisible by 9, then likely one of you
          transposed adjoining numbers; e.g., one entered 69 and the other
          entered 96. If the difference is divisible neither by 2 or by 9, then
          it could be that more than one error is present.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect2" title="16.3.3. Travel Advances"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa8"></a>16.3.3. Travel Advances</h3></div></div></div><p>These are very similar to
          Reimbursable Expenses. The difference is that someone gives you
          money first; you spend it, and then you give a report accounting for
          what you spent it on. The report is supported by invoices establishing
          who, what, where, when, and how much for each expenditure. In the
          Reimbursable Expense case, you spent your money first and later
          recovered it.</p><p>In the Travel Advance case when you receive the advance, you
          record on your books this entry: debit (increase) Bank for the travel
          advance amount received (say, $500); credit (increase) the short-term
          liability Travel Advance ($500). This is a liability, because
          you are not gifted with the money, but only loaned it for the purpose
          of having funds to spend when doing the employer’s business.</p><p>Frequently, the way these monetary arrangements work is that at
          the beginning of for example a salesperson’s employment, he or she receives the advance
          and monthly (or more frequently) turns in a report about who, what,
          where, when, and how much he spent. The money in the report is
          reimbursed if approved.
          </p><p>During the period after receiving the advance and before filing
          a request for reimbursement report, the salesperson can record his or her expenditures into
          the advance liability account. In that case, the balance
          in the account will show how much of the advance has not yet been spent
          (assuming the Travel Advance balance is a credit). If no mistakes have
          been made and all expenses are approved, then the sum of the unspent
          account balance and the reimbursing check amount will equal the original
          travel advance amount.</p><p>It makes sense for the salesperson to record the travel expenses to this advance account (and
          not to his or her own expense accounts), because the money is being spent
          on behalf of the employer, for the employer’s authorized expenses. It
          is not the employee’s own money, and therefore not his or her own expense.
          </p><p>When the salesperson receives the report reimbursement (say, $350), he or she debits
          (increases) Bank, and credits (increases) again the Travel Advance
          liability account, assuming that previously he or she had been recording
          expenditures to the travel advance account. Tracking activity in this
          manner causes the account to always show the amount that is owed the
          employer.</p><p>See <a class="xref" href="accts-oa5.html#accts-oa7" title="16.3.2. Reimbursable Expenses">Section 16.3.2, “Reimbursable Expenses”</a> above for what to do if
          the employer does not accept an item the employee put on the travel
          advance reimbursement request report. The difference resolution effort
          is essentially the same for both types of accounts.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.3.4. Prepaid Premiums or Prepaid Rent"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa9"></a>16.3.4. Prepaid Premiums or Prepaid Rent</h3></div></div></div><p>Some types of
          expenses are usually billed as semi-annual or annual amounts. For
          example, the insurance industry will bill home insurance annually,
          while car insurance premiums can be annual or semi-annual. For those
          that pay an amount that covers several months or a full year, the
          proper accounting treatment is to reflect in each accounting period
          the amount that expresses the benefit applying to that period.</p><p>In the case of someone who pays a full-year’s insurance premium
          at the beginning of the insurance period, the entry to record this is
          debit (increase) Prepaid Insurance Premium for say, $1,200, and credit
          (decrease) Bank for $1,200.</p><p>Then a monthly recurring journal entry (scheduled transaction)
          is created that debits (increases) Insurance Expense $100 and credits
          (decreases) Prepaid Insurance Premium $100. This technique spreads
          the cost over the periods that receive the insurance coverage benefit.
          Businesses following generally accepted accounting practices would
          normally use this technique, especially if they had to present
          financial statements to banks or other lenders. Whether individuals do
          depends on the person and how concerned they are to match cost with
          benefit across time periods. Another factor influencing use of this
          technique would be the number of such situations the person encounters.
          It is relatively easy to remember one or two, but more difficult if
          having to manage 10 to 20. You would set up as many or as few as proved
          useful and important to you.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.3.5. Suspense or Wash Accounts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa10"></a>16.3.5. Suspense or Wash Accounts</h3></div></div></div><p>The purpose of
          these accounts is to provide a device to track <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">change of mind</span>”</span> situations.
          The objective of these accounts is to provide a temporary location to
          record charges and credits that are not to be included permanently in
          your books of record. When the transactions reflected in these accounts
          have been fully completed, Wash/Suspense accounts will normally carry
          a zero balance.</p><p>For example, say in the grocery store you see canned vegetables on sale,
          so you buy 6 cans at $1 per can. Say that the total purchases were $50.
          When you come home and are putting things in the cupboard you discover
          you already had 12 cans. You decide to return the 6 you just bought.
          Some persons in this situation would charge (increase) the whole bill
          to Grocery Expense; and when they returned the cans, they would credit
          (decrease) Grocery Expense. That is one way of handling that. The effect
          of this method is to leave recorded on your books the cost of items that
          you really did not purchase from a permanent standpoint. It is only
          when the items have actually been returned and the vendor’s return
          receipt has also been recorded that the distortion this method generates
          will then be removed.</p><p>Actually, there are several treatments, depending on when and how
         the original transaction was booked/recorded and when you decided to
         return the items purchased. Basically, did you change your mind before
         you recorded the transaction or after doing so?</p><p>If you decided to return the items after recording the purchase
         transaction, you may originally have charged Grocery Expense for the full
         amount ($50) of all items. In that scenario, what you kept and the amount of
         the items to be returned were grouped into one account. You could edit the
         original transaction and restate the amount charged to the Grocery Expense
         account to be the difference ($44) between the total paid ($50) for groceries
         and the value of the items to be returned. That leaves the returned-item
         value as the amount ($6) you should record to the Suspense account.</p><p>Obviously, if you decided to return items before you recorded your
         purchase, then you would book the original entry as a charge to Grocery
         Expense for the amount kept ($44) and as a charge to Suspense for the
         amount returned ($6). The off-setting credit ($50) to cash or credit
         card is not affected by these treatments.</p><p>When there are several persons shopping and at different vendors,
         there can be a case where there are several returns happening at once
         and in overlapping time frames. In that case the Wash Account is
         charged (increased) at time of changing the mind, and either Bank or
         Credit Card is credited. When the return occurs, the reverse happens:
         Bank or Credit Card is debited for the cash value of the returned items
         and the Wash/Suspense Account is credited in the same amount.</p><p>If the wash account has a non-zero balance, scanning the debit
         and credit entries in the account will show the non-matched items.
         That is, debits not matched by offsetting credits indicate items
         intended to be returned but not actually returned yet. The reverse
         (credits not matched by offsetting debits) indicates that returns were
         made but the original charge was not recorded in the Wash Account.</p><p>These differences can be cleared up by returning unreturned items
         or recording charges (debits) for items already returned. The mechanics
         of doing that likely will be finding the original expense account the
         item was charged to and making an entry like: debit Wash Account, credit
         original expense. It also could be as described above where the original
         recording is adjusted by adding a charge to Wash/Suspense account and
         decreasing the amount charged to the original account.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="accts-oa2.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="accts-oa11.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">16.2. Other Assets Described </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="chapter_other_assets.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> 16.4. Short or Long-term Assets</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
