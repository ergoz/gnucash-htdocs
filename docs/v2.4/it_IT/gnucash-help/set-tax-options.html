       have been assigned to accounts, you should be cautioned that you will need 
       to manually change each one if you do so, which could be quite tedious. 
       The tax categories are unique for each Income Tax Entity Type, so changing 
       the type will make all previously assigned categories invalid. It is assumed 
       (and highly recommended) that each <strong class="application"><code>GnuCash</code></strong> file is for only one tax entity
       and this is where you specify its type of tax entity. You should not keep, 
       for example, personal and partnership accounts mixed in one <strong class="application"><code>GnuCash</code></strong> file 
       if you plan to use the Income Tax Reporting features.</p><p>A given <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> code can be assigned to multiple accounts. The Tax Schedule 
       Report will combine accounts by code and generate a detailed <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> record for 
       each account and a summary <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> record for the total as calculated by the 
       report.</p><p>For codes for which the "Payer Name Source" is not grayed, the payer 
       on the <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> record will be based on what is specified here, either the 
       account name of the account or the account name of the account’s parent 
       account. This feature is typically used for interest accounts or stocks or 
       mutual funds that pay dividends where the individual payees are shown on
       the tax schedule. For example, if the parent account’s name is the name of 
       your broker and the sub-account’s names are the names of individual stocks 
       that pay dividends and the name on the 1099-DIV received is that of the 
       broker, in order to match that name, you would select ’Parent Account’; 
       the total dividends from the broker would be exported and, if you had 
       several brokers, there would be an amount exported and a subtotal for each 
       broker, along with each brokers name. Alternatively, if you had a parent 
       account named <span class="emphasis"><strong>Directly Held</strong></span>, for example, and below it sub-accounts for 
       one or more stocks, you would receive a 1099-DIV from the issuer of each 
       stock separately and, in order to match that name, you would select 
       <span class="guilabel"><strong>Current Account</strong></span>; the total dividends from each stock would be exported 
       and, if you had several stocks, there would be an amount exported and a 
       subtotal for each stock, along with each stock’s name as the payer.</p><p>Some tax Forms/Schedules need to have multiple copies filed under
       some circumstances (for example, Schedule C if a taxpayer and spouse have 
       separate businesses). For tax categories on these Forms/Schedules, the 
       <span class="guilabel"><strong>Copy Number</strong></span> is not grayed out and can be used to segregate accounts by 
       copy number.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Accounts: This pane contains the list of accounts. Select an

         date acquired and cost basis information left blank (to be separately 
         added in the tax software). The code can be assigned to either a short-,
         long-, or mixed-term gain/loss income account and the security sales 
         transaction should be entered as illustrated in Section 8.7, Selling 
         Shares, of the <strong class="application"><code>GnuCash</code></strong> Tutorial and Concepts Guide. The report uses the 
         transaction split of the gain/loss account to find one or more other 
         splits in the same transaction with negative share quantities. For each 
         of these found, it generates a detailed <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> output record with the 
         quantity sold, the name of the security, the date sold, and the sales 
         amount. Note that if, for a given transaction, more than one transaction 
         split is to a gain/loss income account assigned to code 673, <acronym class="acronym">TXF</acronym> output 
         data will be erroneously repeated. That is because the report will 
         fetch the same data, and re-output it, for each transaction split set 
         to a gain/loss income account within the same transaction. For this 
         reason, there should be no more than one gain/loss account entered per
         transaction to use this tax reporting code properly. (Note that 
         no amounts are used from <strong class="application"><code>GnuCash</code></strong>’s lot-tracking; a future enhancement
