When used to setup
           a scheduled transaction, the assistant creates a variable formula so that the
           compounding interest is correctly calculated. To start this assistant manually go to
           <span class="guilabel"><strong>Actions</strong></span> → <span class="guisubmenu"><strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong></span> → <span class="guimenuitem"><strong>Mortgage and Loan Repayment...</strong></span>.</p><p>The Mortgage and Loan Repayment assistant opens with a screen that briefly
           describes what this assistant does. The three buttons at the very bottom of the screen
           will not change while using the assistant.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="guibutton">Cancel</span> button is used to exit the assistant and cancel creating the

           usually the information provided by the bank when loan and disclosure documents
           are given to the borrower. Here you can also setup an account that the scheduled
           transaction will use to enter the payment transaction.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="guilabel"><strong>Loan Account:</strong></span> Choose an account for the loan payment transactions or use

           loan. It is mainly used for mortgage payments. When each of the options here is set,
           this enables additional pages in the assistant to setup those portions of the payments.
           All of the pages will be described here, even though some may not show if that
           option is not chosen.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>... utilize an escrow account for payments?: This selection enables the
