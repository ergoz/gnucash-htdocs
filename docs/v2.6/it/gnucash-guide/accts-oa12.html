          exceed a year) and discusses these types: land, buildings, leasehold
          improvements, intangibles, vehicles and other equipment.</p><div class="sect2" title="16.5.1. Terreni"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa13"></a>16.5.1. Terreni</h3></div></div></div><p>Land is not a wasting asset. That is, it
         does not get used up over time and rarely suffers damage such that it
         loses value. For that reason, it usually is recorded at cost at the
         time of purchase. Appreciation in its value over decades is not recorded
         and is not recognized in any way on the books of the owner. It is only
         after land has been sold that sale price and purchase cost are compared
         to calculate gain or loss on sale.</p><p>Land is frequently sold/purchased in combination with structures
         upon it. That means that the cost has to become separated from the
         cost of structures on it. Land valuation is usually part of the transfer
         of ownership process and its value is shown on the purchase documents
         separately from that of any structures it supports.</p><p>Land values shown on purchase documents frequently arise from the
         process of value determination managed by assessors whose job it is
         to assign values to land for tax purposes. Local and regional areas of
         a state or province use the values determined by assessors in their tax
         formulas, which provide revenues for local and regional governing
         authorities to finance their required community services.</p><p>Should land be acquired in a situation not subject to a history of
         land valuation by a formal valuation system, then the purchaser can appeal
         to real estate agents and an examination of recent sale transactions for
         information that would allow calculating a reasonable amount to express
         the value of the land.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.5.2. Edifici"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa14"></a>16.5.2. Edifici</h3></div></div></div><p>Buildings are the man-made <span class="quote">«<span class="quote">caves</span>»</span> in which
         much of life’s human interaction occurs. These structures are wasting
         assets, because in their use they or their components gradually wear.
         Over time they begin to lose some of their function and they can suffer
         damage due to planetary elements or human action.</p><p>Accepted accounting practice is to record the cost of the building
         determined at time of ownership transfer (purchase) or at conclusion of all
         costs of construction. Because buildings are frequently used for decades,
         and due to the need to be able to calculate gain or loss on sale,
         accounting practice preserves the original cost by not recording declines
         in value in the account containing the original purchase or construction
         cost.</p><p>Instead, the depreciation technique is used to show (in the
         balance sheet) the structure’s net book value (original cost reduced by
         accumulated depreciation). Depreciation is a separate topic treated
         elsewhere in this Guide.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.5.3. Leasehold Improvements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa15"></a>16.5.3. Leasehold Improvements</h3></div></div></div><p>When a business does
         not own the building where it operates, and instead has a long-term
         lease, it is not uncommon for the business tenant to make improvements to
         the premises so that the structure obtains both function and appearance
         that enhances conducting its business activities.</p><p>In these cases, the expenditures that the business incurs are recorded
         in a Leasehold Improvements account: increase (debit) Leasehold Improvements,
         decrease (credit) Bank or increase (credit) a suitable liability account
         (which could be a liability to a contractor or a bank or a credit card,
         etc.).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.5.4. Veicoli o attrezzature"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa16"></a>16.5.4. Veicoli o attrezzature</h3></div></div></div><p>Vehicles or Equipment of all kinds usually
         last for several years, but their useful lives are much shorter than
         that of assets that have little movement in their functioning. Because
         they do wear out over time, common accounting practice in business is
         to record depreciation using life spans and depreciation methods
         appropriate to the nature and use of the asset. Frequently, the life
         and depreciation methods chosen are influenced by what is permitted per
         national tax regulations for the kind of asset being depreciated.</p><p>Usually, businesses depreciate their assets. Individuals can
         do so as well to the degree that taxing authorities permit. Very wealthy
         persons employ accountants and attorneys to track and manage their
         investments and assets holdings to take advantage of all tax benefits
         permitted by law.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="16.5.5. Intangibles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="accts-oa17"></a>16.5.5. Intangibles</h3></div></div></div><p>The mechanics of accounting (debiting
         and crediting appropriate accounts) for these assets are relatively simple,
         much the same as for any of the above assets. Where the difficulty lies
         is in their valuation, which is an advanced topic and not something that
         individual persons and small businesses would likely encounter. For that
         reason further discussion of items such as patents, copyrights, goodwill,
         etc. are left out of this Guide.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="accts-oa11.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Indietro</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Partenza</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch_python_bindigs.html">Avanti &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">16.4. Short or Long-term Assets </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="chapter_other_assets.html">Risali</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> Capitolo 17. Python Bindings</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
